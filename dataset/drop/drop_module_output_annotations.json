This backfired when the Redskins running back Quinton Ganther recovered the kick and returned it 25 yards to the Eagles 24-yard line. Four plays later, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell ran for a two-yard touchdown to score the game's first touchdown, as the Redskins took the lead 7-0. After a holding penalty on Eagles tight end Brent Celek, the Eagles had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker David Akers. On the following drive by the Eagles, quarterback Donovan McNabb found wide receiver DeSean Jackson wide open in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown to bring the Eagles up 10-7. On the ensuing drive by the Redskins, Campbell threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss to take the lead 14-10. Late in the second quarter, after both teams punting the ball away after three unsuccessful drives, Eagles cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a Jason Campbell pass that was intended for Santana Moss. The Eagles could not convert a third down with 10 to go, and David Akers kicked a 24-yard field goal to get the Eagles within a point of the Redskins, 14-13. The Redskins received the ball again and Campbell threw a second straight interception to Samuel, who returned it for 17 yards. The Eagles ended the first half with a second straight field goal to take the lead 16-14. The Eagles got the ball to start the second half, but the drive ended with a Sav Rocca punt. Jason Campbell threw a 10-yard touchdown to tight end Fred Davis to take the lead once again, 21-16. After two straight punts for each team, the Eagles got the ball back in the fourth quarter and Donovan McNabb threw an intended pass to Reggie Brown, but the pass was intercepted by Redskins cornerback Justin Tryon. The Redskins scored on a 25-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham, to increase their lead 24-16. The Eagles started their drive on their own 10-yard line after a penalty on the kick return by Dimitri Patterson. The Eagles went 90 yards to score on an Eldra Buckley one-yard touchdown run. Since they were losing by two points, the Eagles decided to go for a two-point conversion.

Nugent kicked a 34-yard field goal for a 6-0 Jets lead. Houston rebounded, with David Carr converting a key third down to Andre Johnson to set up Kris Brown's 47-yard field goal. Pennington completed a long pass to Jerricho Cotchery on the next drive to set up Nugent's career-long 54-yard field goal to give the Jets a 9-3 lead. The half ended when Brown came up five yards short on a 59-yard field goal attempt. On the Jets' first possession of the second half, following a Houston punt, Pennington completed long passes to Chris Baker and Cotchery before finding Coles on a 12-yard touchdown pass. On the Jets' next drive, fans everywhere held their breath when Pennington was drilled by Mario Williams while releasing a pass and was slow to get up. Luckily, he only had the wind knocked out of him. Kerry Rhodes intercepted Carr soon after, and Pennington completed another long pass to Cotchery to set up Cedric Houston's 1-yard touchdown run and a 23-3 lead.

From this point on the intervention of the King of Castile increased. Between 1418 and 1445 dominion over the islands changed hands on a number of occasions. Finally, control over the conquered islands and the right to further conquests fell to Hern\u00e1n Peraza The Elder and his children Guill\u00e9n Peraza and In\u00e9s Peraza. The death of Guill\u00e9n Peraza in the attack on La Palma has been immortalized in a moving lament. After the death of her brother In\u00e9s and her husband Diego Garc\u00eda de Herrera became the sole rulers of the islands until 1477 when they ceded La Gomera to their son Hern\u00e1n Peraza The Younger and the rights to the conquest of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife to the King of Castile. The island of La Gomera was not taken in battle but was incorporated into the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom through an agreement between Hern\u00e1n Peraza The Elder and some of the insular aboriginal groups who accepted the rule of the Castilian.

Perhaps as a precautionary measure , the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751 . While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma , the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu . Deeply concerned , the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two - thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752 . This redeployment of Hanthawaddy troops proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance groups much needed breathing room . The Hanthawaddy command left less than 10,000 men to pacify all of Upper Burma . Taking advantage of light Hanthawaddy troops , one resistance group , the Konbaung Dynasty led by Alaungpaya , drove out Hanthawaddy troops from Upper Burma by May 1754 . Konbaung armies invaded Lower Burma in 1755 , and captured Pegu in 1757 , ending the 17 - year - old Mon kingdom .", "passage_charidxs": [0, 3, 7, 9, 13, 17, 20, 26, 32, 41, 49, 53, 61, 69, 73, 81, 85, 94, 106, 114, 120, 123, 128, 130, 141, 145, 150, 152, 156, 168, 175, 180, 188, 196, 202, 207, 208, 214, 222, 228, 230, 234, 242, 247, 257, 260, 268, 275, 281, 284, 290, 296, 298, 305, 311, 324, 330, 337, 347, 350, 354, 356, 365, 367, 371, 379, 385, 393, 398, 409, 412, 416, 424, 434, 437, 446, 450, 456, 460, 464, 469, 472, 476, 478, 481, 485, 487, 492, 497, 499, 510, 518, 521, 525, 528, 537, 541, 551, 561, 566, 568, 572, 577, 586, 589, 593, 601, 606, 621, 627, 629, 634, 638, 641, 645, 651, 656, 660, 663, 667, 672, 676, 678, 681, 685, 687, 696, 708, 715, 720, 728, 731, 734, 737, 739, 743, 751, 760, 766, 770, 780, 783, 791, 798, 806, 812, 815, 820, 829, 837, 839, 847, 850, 852, 866, 873, 875, 879, 887, 895, 898, 903, 909, 917, 922, 927, 931, 937, 943, 946, 950, 952, 958, 961, 969, 977, 980, 983, 991, 995, 1003, 1008, 1017, 1020, 1023, 1030, 1034, 1040, 1045, 1054, 1060, 1065, 1067, 1071, 1079, 1086, 1098, 1103, 1109, 1115, 1118, 1122, 1124, 1131, 1140, 1142, 1146, 1158, 1169, 1178, 1181, 1182, 1189, 1192, 1198, 1203, 1208, 1213, 1216, 1222, 1228, 1240, 1246, 1251, 1255, 1263, 1267, 1272, 1280, 1285, 1288, 1294, 1298, 1300, 1305, 1318, 1321, 1333, 1340, 1347, 1349, 1358, 1366, 1372, 1375, 1383, 1391, 1394, 1397, 1402, 1410, 1416, 1424, 1435, 1442, 1447, 1454, 1464, 1468, 1470, 1474, 1486, 1494, 1499, 1504, 1509, 1516, 1520, 1523, 1530, 1534, 1537, 1543, 1548, 1550, 1557, 1567, 1570, 1576, 1588, 1594, 1596, 1600, 1611, 1616, 1618, 1622, 1631, 1639, 1643, 1646, 1656, 1658, 1664, 1668, 1680, 1687, 1692, 1698, 1704, 1707, 1711, 1715, 1717, 1726, 1733, 1741, 1747, 1753, 1756, 1760, 1762, 1766, 1775, 1780, 1783, 1787, 1789, 1796, 1800, 1802, 1803, 1807, 1808, 1812, 1816, 1823], "passage_sent_idxs": [[0, 23], [23, 40], [40, 61], [61, 83], [83, 110], [110, 122], [122, 134], [134, 150], [150, 171], [171, 202], [202, 233], [233, 259], [259, 274], [274, 303], [303, 327]], "passage_DATE_mens": [["1740", [1, 1], [-1, -1, 1740]], ["1745", [84, 84], [-1, -1, 1745]], ["1751", [123, 123], [-1, -1, 1751]], ["1751", [169, 169], [-1, -1, 1751]], ["April 1752", [230, 231], [-1, 4, 1752]], ["May 1754", [300, 301], [-1, 5, 1754]], ["1755", [309, 309], [-1, -1, 1755]], ["1757", [315, 315], [-1, -1, 1757]]], "passage_DATE_men2entidx": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "passage_DATE_normalized_values": [[-1, -1, 1740], [-1, -1, 1745], [-1, -1, 1751], [-1, 4, 1752], [-1, 5, 1754], [-1, -1, 1755], [-1, -1, 1757]], "passage_NUM_mens": [["one", 281, 1], ["two", 209, 2], ["17", 319, 17], ["1740", 1, 1740], ["1745", 84, 1745], ["1751", 123, 1751], ["1751", 169, 1751], ["1752", 231, 1752], ["1754", 301, 1754], ["1755", 309, 1755], ["1757", 315, 1757], ["10,000", 265, 10000]], "passage_NUM_men2entidx": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "passage_NUM_normalized_values": [1, 2, 17, 1740, 1745, 1751, 1752, 1754, 1755, 1757, 10000]}, "history_725": {"passage": "In September 1998, Barzani and Talabani signed the U.S.-mediated Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty.

In 1669, Louis Laneau, Bishop of Motella, also a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, was named head of a Roman Catholic mission in mainland Southeast Asia, with his headquarters at Ayutthaya. They propagated the Christian faith and also took care of Annamite Christians and Japanese Christian communities in Thailand. Narai welcomed these missionaries, providing them with land for a church, a mission-house and a seminary .Bishops Lambert and Ballue established a Western hospital in Thailand in 1669 at Ayutthaya, with Father Laneau as the head doctor.

After Atlanta punted to start the game, Manning was intercepted by Demorrio Williams, but two minutes later, Michael Vick was intercepted by Sam Madison. After forcing a Giants punt, Vick fumbled, with Madison recovering. Manning threw another pick on the next drive, this time to DeAngelo Hall. Looking to break the game open in the second half, the Falcons turned to Warrick Dunn, who busted through a huge hole en route to a 90-yard touchdown run, the longest in Atlanta history.  The score put the Falcons up 14-3, but Big Blue took command after that.  Seizing control, the Giants used the legs of Barber and some fine passing from Manning to get back into the game.  An 84-yard drive was finished with a two yard plunge by Brandon Jacobs.  After an Atlanta three and out, the Giants again drove the length of the field, with Barber leading the charge.  Eli Manning finished off the 91 yard scamper with a short play-action touchdown to tight end Jeremy Shockey. The Giants would utilize a heavy pass rush to force the Falcons to punt again and after a Jay Feely field goal from 39 yards, the offense put the game away.  Manning hit Shockey on another touchdown late, finishing off the Falcons.  For the day, Manning was 17 of 30 for 180 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.  Barber rushed for 185 yards and Jacobs added 53.  Shockey re-emerged in this game with six receptions, including the two touchdowns.

The war however had created a demographic and economic crisis in the Peloponnese. According to the first census conducted by the Venetians, there were 86,468 people in the peninsula compared to a pre-war population of around 200,000.

The Colts subsequently re-claimed the lead, with Luck connecting on a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback Stanley Havili, then added to their lead, with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Luck to tight end Coby Fleener just before halftime. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their first three possessions of the third quarter, and the Colts took a 33-14 lead, with Luck rushing for a 10-yard touchdown. Late in the third quarter, the Broncos tried to cut into the Colts lead, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but the Colts responded early in the fourth quarter, with a 52-yard field goal by Vinatieri.

The Novgorodians asked the Swedish king to install one of his sons \u2014 Carl Filip or Gustavus Adolphus \u2014 as their monarch. In the meantime, Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne. The young king decided to press his brother's claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising of 1612 and Mikhail Romanov had been elected a new tsar. While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign. In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their \"Wildcat\" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the \"Wildcat\" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the \"Great Elector\" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of J\u00e4gerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of J\u00e4gerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims.
